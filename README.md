Features:
Face Detection using OpenCV's Haar Cascade.
Face Recognition using a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier.
Real-time Attendance Marking and storage in CSV files.
Easy User Management with the ability to add and delete users.
Data stored in local directories, with attendance saved for each day.
------------------------------------------------------------------
Technologies Used:
